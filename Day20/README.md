<h1>Univariate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
    <p>Univariate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in the data analysis process. It involves examining and summarizing the characteristics of a single variable (or feature) in a dataset to gain insights into its distribution, central tendencies, variability, and any potential outliers. Univariate EDA is particularly helpful for understanding the fundamental properties of a variable before moving on to more complex analyses or modeling.</p>

  <h2>Main Steps and Techniques</h2>

  <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Begin by collecting the dataset you want to analyze. Ensure that the data is clean and in a format suitable for analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Summary Statistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Descriptive Statistics</h4>
                    <p>Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, and standard deviation. These statistics provide an overview of the central tendency and variability of the variable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Frequency Counts</h4>
                    <p>For categorical variables, count the frequency of each category to understand the distribution of values.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Histogram</h4>
                    <p>Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of continuous numerical variables. Histograms provide insights into the shape of the distribution, including whether it's normal, skewed, or bimodal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Box Plot</h4>
                    <p>A box plot (box-and-whisker plot) helps identify potential outliers and provides a summary of the data's central tendency and spread.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Bar Chart</h4>
                    <p>Use bar charts for categorical variables to display the frequency of each category.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Kernel Density Plot</h4>
                    <p>This plot provides a smoothed estimate of the probability density function of a continuous variable.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Data Transformation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Normalization</h4>
                    <p>If the variable has a non-standard scale or units, consider normalizing or standardizing it to make comparisons easier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Log Transformation</h4>
                    <p>Apply a log transformation to highly skewed data to make the distribution more symmetric.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Outlier Detection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Use statistical methods like the IQR (Interquartile Range) or z-scores to identify potential outliers in the data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Visualize outliers using box plots or scatter plots.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Missing Values</h3>
            <p>Check for missing values in the variable and decide on an appropriate strategy for handling them, such as imputation or removal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Additional Visualizations</h3>
            <p>Depending on the nature of the variable, consider other visualizations like density plots, violin plots, or cumulative distribution plots.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Inferential Statistics</h3>
            <p>Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) if you have specific questions or hypotheses about the variable's relationship with other variables.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Interpretation and Insights</h3>
            <p>Summarize your findings, draw conclusions about the variable's characteristics, and consider how these insights might relate to the overall objectives of your analysis.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

  <p>Remember that univariate EDA is just the first step in the data analysis process. After gaining a solid understanding of individual variables, you can move on to bivariate or multivariate analyses to explore relationships between variables and gain deeper insights into your data.</p>
