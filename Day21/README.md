<h1>Bivariate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
    <p>Bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis that involves examining the relationships between two variables. Here's a brief overview of the key steps and techniques typically used in bivariate EDA:</p>

  <ol>
        <li><strong>Scatterplots:</strong> Create scatterplots to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Scatterplots help you identify patterns, trends, and outliers in your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's correlation) to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. A positive correlation indicates a positive association, while a negative correlation indicates a negative association.</li>
        <li><strong>Categorical vs. Continuous:</strong> When one variable is categorical and the other is continuous, consider using box plots, violin plots, or bar charts to visualize the distribution of the continuous variable within each category.</li>
        <li><strong>Contingency Tables:</strong> If both variables are categorical, create a contingency table (cross-tabulation) to see how they are related. You can also calculate measures like Chi-squared statistics to assess independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> Perform simple linear regression or multiple regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This helps in predicting values based on the relationship observed.</li>
        <li><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Use heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix when you have multiple continuous variables. This can reveal patterns of correlation or multicollinearity.</li>
        <li><strong>Grouped Analysis:</strong> If you have more than two variables, consider grouping and color-coding in your visualizations to explore interactions and patterns among variables simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in the means of a continuous variable across different levels of a categorical variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Identify and handle outliers appropriately, as they can have a significant impact on the relationships observed between variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong> Always inspect your data visually, looking for any unusual patterns or trends that may warrant further investigation.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Remember that the goal of bivariate EDA is to gain a preliminary understanding of how two variables relate to each other. It's a critical step before more advanced analyses like multivariate regression or machine learning modeling.</p>
