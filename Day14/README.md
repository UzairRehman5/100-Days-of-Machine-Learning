<h1>Outlier Detection and Removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method</h1>
    <p>Outlier Detection and Removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method is a common technique for identifying and handling outliers in a dataset. This method is suitable for datasets with continuous or numerical variables. Here's how it works:</p>


  <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> The IQR method is robust to extreme values (outliers) because it focuses on the middle 50% of the data distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The method is easy to understand and implement.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> It provides clear boundaries for identifying outliers.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Loss of Information:</strong> Removing outliers can lead to a loss of valuable data that may contain meaningful information.</li>
        <li><strong>Subjectivity:</strong> The choice of the 1.5 multiplier in defining the bounds can be somewhat arbitrary and may affect which data points are labeled as outliers.</li>
        <li><strong>Univariate Focus:</strong> The IQR method primarily detects univariate outliers and may not capture multivariate outliers or outliers in high-dimensional data.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Suitable Distributions</h3>
    <p>The IQR method is most effective when dealing with datasets that have a roughly symmetric or skewed distribution. It may not work as well for datasets with highly skewed or heavy-tailed distributions, as it could lead to the classification of some valid data points as outliers or the failure to identify certain outliers. In such cases, alternative outlier detection methods, such as those based on z-scores or robust statistical tests, might be more appropriate.</p>

  <p>It's important to consider the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis when deciding whether to use the IQR method for outlier detection and how to handle identified outliers. Additionally, a combination of multiple outlier detection methods and domain knowledge can enhance the robustness of the analysis.</p>
