<h1>Simple Imputer</h1>


A "SimpleImputer" is a class from the scikit-learn library in Python that is used for imputing (filling in) missing values in datasets. It provides a straightforward way to handle missing data by replacing missing values with a specified constant or the mean, median, or most frequent value along each column.
