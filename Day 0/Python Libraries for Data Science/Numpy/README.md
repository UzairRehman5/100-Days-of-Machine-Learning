<ul>
    <li>NumPy is a Python library for scientific computing.</li>
    <li>It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.</li>
    <li>It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.</li>
    <li>NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.</li>
    <li>They are also easier to manipulate and can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations.</li>
    <li>Creating and manipulating arrays: NumPy provides a variety of functions for creating and manipulating arrays. For example, you can create an array of numbers, or an array of strings. You can also resize, reshape, and sort arrays.</li>
    <li>Performing mathematical operations on arrays: NumPy provides a variety of functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays. For example, you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide arrays. You can also apply trigonometric functions and statistical functions to arrays.</li>
    <li>Linear algebra operations: NumPy provides a variety of functions for performing linear algebra operations on arrays. For example, you can find the determinant of a matrix, or the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.</li>
   <li>Statistical operations: NumPy provides a variety of functions for performing statistical operations on arrays. For example, you can calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance of an array.</li>
