<h1>Day 6 - Web Scrapping</h1>

**Web scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves automated methods for fetching and parsing web content to gather information from web pages. This data can then be used for various purposes, such as analysis, research, or data integration into other applications.

In the notebook, I have scraped the website 'airlinequality' to extract customer reviews of British aircraft and the services they provide.

Additionally, I have also added the CSV file that contains the data I have scraped.
