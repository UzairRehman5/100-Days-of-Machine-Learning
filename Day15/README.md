<h1>Outlier Detection and Removal using the Z-Score Method</h1>
    <p>Outlier Detection and Removal using the Z-Score Method is a statistical technique for identifying and handling outliers in a dataset. This method is based on the standard score or Z-score, which measures how far a data point is from the mean of the dataset in terms of standard deviations. Here's how it works:</p>

  <h3>When to Use</h3>
    <p>The Z-score method is suitable for datasets that have a roughly normal distribution or approximately follow a Gaussian distribution. It assumes that the data is normally distributed, and it is most effective when this assumption holds. However, it can still be applied to datasets with other distributions, but its performance may be suboptimal in such cases.</p>

  <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> The Z-score method is effective at identifying outliers based on how far they deviate from the mean in terms of standard deviations.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The method is relatively simple to calculate and implement.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> Z-scores have a clear interpretation, representing the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sensitivity to Distribution:</strong> The Z-score method assumes that the data follows a normal distribution. If the data deviates significantly from normality, the method may not perform well.</li>
        <li><strong>Outlier Definition:</strong> The choice of the Z-score threshold is somewhat arbitrary and can influence which data points are labeled as outliers.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact on Sample Size:</strong> Removing outliers can reduce the sample size, potentially affecting statistical power.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>In summary, the Z-score method is a widely used technique for identifying and handling outliers, especially when the data is normally distributed or approximately so. However, it's important to be cautious when applying this method to datasets with non-normal distributions, as it may lead to the misidentification of valid data points as outliers or the failure to detect certain outliers. Consider the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis when deciding whether to use the Z-score method for outlier detection.</p>
