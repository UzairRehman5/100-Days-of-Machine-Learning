<h1>Day 8 - Automated Data Analysis using Pandas Profililing </h1>


Pandas Profiling is a Python library used for generating a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) report for a given dataset. 
Pandas Profiling is a valuable tool for quickly understanding your data, especially when dealing with new datasets or when performing initial data exploration in data science and machine learning projects. 
It helps data analysts and scientists save time by automating the process of generating basic insights and visualizations.

Here are some key features and functions of Pandas Profiling:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Automatic Report Generation: Pandas Profiling generates a comprehensive report automatically with just a single line of code. This report includes information about data types, missing values, basic statistics, and more.</li>
    <li>Data Overview: It provides an overview of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and a preview of the first and last few rows.</li>
    <li>Data Types: Pandas Profiling identifies and lists the data types of each column in the dataset.</li>
    <li>Missing Values: It reports the number and percentage of missing values for each column.</li>
    <li>Basic Statistics: You get basic statistics for numerical columns, such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.</li>
    <li>Common Values: It displays the most common values for categorical columns.</li>
    <li>Correlations: The library calculates and visualizes correlations between numerical columns using various methods like Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations.</li>
    <li>Distribution of Data: Pandas Profiling provides histograms for numerical data and bar plots for categorical data to visualize data distributions.</li>
    <li>Interactions: It can identify potential interactions between columns, such as high correlation between two numerical variables.</li>
    <li>Warnings: The report may include warnings or suggestions for issues it identifies, such as high cardinality in categorical columns.</li>
    <li>Sample: You can see a random sample of the data to get a better understanding of its content.</li>
    <li>Exporting Reports: The generated report can be saved as an HTML file, making it easy to share and view.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, please note that the csv files used in the notebook and the generated html analysis file are included in this folder.
