<h1>Outlier Detection and Removal using Percentile Method</h1>

<p>The percentile method is a statistical technique for outlier detection and removal. It works by identifying data points that fall outside a certain range of values, as defined by the percentiles.The percentiles are the values that fall below a certain percentage of the data points. For example, the 95th percentile is the value that falls below 95% of the data points. Once you have chosen the percentiles, you can calculate the threshold values for each percentile. The threshold value for the 95th percentile, for example, is the value that falls below 95% of the data points. Any data points that fall below the threshold value for a given percentile are considered outliers.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is simple and easy to implement.</li>
<li>It is relatively efficient, as it only requires the calculation of a few percentiles.</li>
<li>It is effective in detecting outliers in a variety of data sets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>It can remove legitimate data points.</li>
<li>It is not as sensitive to outliers as other methods, such as the Grubbs test or the Mahalanobis distance.</li>
<li>It can be difficult to choose the appropriate percentiles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Additional Considerations when using the Percentile Method:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The choice of percentiles is important. The higher the percentiles, the more outliers will be detected. However, too high a percentile can also remove legitimate data points.</li>
<li>The method can be sensitive to the distribution of the data. If the data is not normally distributed, the method may not be as effective in detecting outliers.</li>
<li>The method can be computationally expensive for large data sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the percentile method is a simple and effective way to detect outliers. However, it is important to use the method with caution and to consider the specific characteristics of the data set.</p>
