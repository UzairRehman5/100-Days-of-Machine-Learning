<h1>Ordinal Encoding</h1>
<p>Ordinal encoding is a type of categorical encoding that assigns numerical values to categorical data in a way that preserves the order of the categories. For example, if a categorical feature has the values "low", "medium", and "high", then ordinal encoding would assign the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> to these categories, respectively.</p>
<p>Ordinal encoding is a good choice for categorical data that has an inherent order, such as data about the severity of a disease or the level of education of a person. Ordinal encoding can help machine learning models to learn the relationships between different features and to make better predictions.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>It preserves the order of the categories, which can be important for machine learning models.</li>
<li>It is relatively easy to implement.</li>
<li>It is a lossless encoding, which means that no information is lost in the encoding process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>It can be sensitive to the order of the categories. If the order of the categories is changed, then the encoded values will also change.</li>
<li>It can only be used for categorical data that has an inherent order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, ordinal encoding is a versatile and effective way to encode categorical data. It is a good choice for machine learning models that need to learn the relationships between different features.</p>
